# StockAnalysis

This R script reads in a dataset of stock prices and analysizes it to find patterns match the input master pattern. This pattern matching is used to predict the trend for the next few data points for our master pattern, which hopefully will allow us to predict market trends on a short to medium range time scale. This script was written by Sam Hollenbach, with assistance from Jonathan Goldman. In the future this script will be converted to Python and expended to contain future trendline analysis.

Right now the script reads in a file named IVE_bidask1min.txt, but this can be changed easily at the top of the script file.
